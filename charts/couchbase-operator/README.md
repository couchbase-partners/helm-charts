# couchbase-operator

A Helm chart to deploy the Couchbase Autonomous Operator for easily deploying, managing, and maintaining Couchbase Clusters. Couchbase Server is a NoSQL document database with a distributed architecture for performance, scalability, and availability. It enables developers to build applications easier and faster by leveraging the power of SQL with the flexibility of JSON.

Deploying the Operator and Couchbase Server
===========================================

### REQUIRED
* [Helm 3.1+](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases) is required when installing the couchbase cluster chart.
*  A license for Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition.

### Quick Start
The Couchbase Operator can be used to instantly deploy the Autonomous Operator, Admission Controller, and Couchbase Cluster.
Additonally, Sync Gateway can be deployed, along with auto-generation of TLS and networking services.

To quickly deploy the admission controller and Operator, as well as a
Couchbase Server cluster:

1.  Add the chart repository to `helm`:
```console
helm repo add couchbase https://couchbase-partners.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```
2.  Install the Chart:
```console
helm upgrade --install default couchbase/couchbase-operator
```
See Couchbase Helm [Documentation](https://docs.couchbase.com/operator/current/helm-setup-guide.html)
for more information about customizing and managing your charts.

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage- resources-containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| buckets.default.compressionMode | string | `"passive"` | CompressionMode defines how Couchbase server handles document compression.  When off, documents are stored in memory, and transferred to the client uncompressed. When passive, documents are stored compressed in memory, and transferred to the client compressed when requested.  When active, documents are stored compresses in memory and when transferred to the client.  This field must be "off", "passive" or "active", defaulting to "passive".  Be aware "off" in YAML 1.2 is a boolean, so must be quoted as a string in configuration files. |
| buckets.default.conflictResolution | string | `"seqno"` | ConflictResolution defines how XDCR handles concurrent write conflicts. Sequence number based resolution selects the document with the highest sequence number as the most recent. Timestamp based resolution selects the document that was written to most recently as the most recent.  This field must be "seqno" (sequence based), or "lww" (timestamp based), defaulting to "seqno". |
| buckets.default.enableFlush | bool | `false` | EnableFlush defines whether a client can delete all documents in a bucket. This field defaults to false. |
| buckets.default.enableIndexReplica | bool | `false` | EnableIndexReplica defines whether indexes for this bucket are replicated. This field defaults to false. |
| buckets.default.evictionPolicy | string | `"valueOnly"` | EvictionPolicy controls how Couchbase handles memory exhaustion.  Value only eviction flushes documents to disk but maintains document metadata in memory in order to improve query performance.  Full eviction removes all data from memory after the document is flushed to disk.  This field must be "valueOnly" or "fullEviction", defaulting to "valueOnly". |
| buckets.default.historyRetention | object | `{"bytes":null,"collectionHistoryDefault":true,"seconds":null}` | HistoryRetention configures settings for bucket history retention and default values for associated collections. |
| buckets.default.historyRetention.bytes | string | `nil` | Bytes defines how much history an individual vbucket should aim to retain on disk in bytes. This field defaults to 0 and has a minimum working value of 2147483648. This is only supported on buckets with storageBackend=magma. |
| buckets.default.historyRetention.collectionHistoryDefault | bool | `true` | CollectionHistoryDefault determines whether history retention is enabled for newly created collections by default. This field defaults to true. This is only supported on buckets with storageBackend=magma. |
| buckets.default.historyRetention.seconds | string | `nil` | Seconds defines how many seconds of history an individual vbucket should aim to retain on disk. This field defaults to 0. This is only supported on buckets with storageBackend=magma. |
| buckets.default.ioPriority | string | `"low"` | IOPriority controls how many threads a bucket has, per pod, to process reads and writes. This field must be "low" or "high", defaulting to "low". Modification of this field will cause a temporary service disruption as threads are restarted. |
| buckets.default.kind | string | `"CouchbaseBucket"` | The type of the bucket to create by default. Removed from CRD as only used by Helm. |
| buckets.default.maxTTL | string | `nil` | MaxTTL defines how long a document is permitted to exist for, without modification, until it is automatically deleted.  This is a default and maximum time-to-live and may be set to a lower value by the client.  If the client specifies a higher value, then it is truncated to the maximum durability.  Documents are removed by Couchbase, after they have expired, when either accessed, the expiry pager is run, or the bucket is compacted. When set to 0, then documents are not expired by default.  This field must be a duration in the range 0-2147483648s, defaulting to 0.  More info: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration |
| buckets.default.memoryQuota | string | `"100Mi"` | MemoryQuota is a memory limit to the size of a bucket.  When this limit is exceeded, documents will be evicted from memory to disk as defined by the eviction policy.  The memory quota is defined per Couchbase pod running the data service.  This field defaults to, and must be greater than or equal to 100Mi.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| buckets.default.minimumDurability | string | `nil` | MiniumumDurability defines how durable a document write is by default, and can be made more durable by the client.  This feature enables ACID transactions. When none, Couchbase server will respond when the document is in memory, it will become eventually consistent across the cluster. When majority, Couchbase server will respond when the document is replicated to at least half of the pods running the data service in the cluster.  When majorityAndPersistActive, Couchbase server will respond when the document is replicated to at least half of the pods running the data service in the cluster and the document has been persisted to disk on the document master pod.  When persistToMajority, Couchbase server will respond when the document is replicated and persisted to disk on at least half of the pods running the data service in the cluster.  This field must be either "none", "majority", "majorityAndPersistActive" or "persistToMajority", defaulting to "none". |
| buckets.default.name | string | `nil` | Name is the name of the bucket within Couchbase server.  By default the Operator will use the `metadata.name` field to define the bucket name. The `metadata.name` field only supports a subset of the supported character set.  When specified, this field overrides `metadata.name`. Legal bucket names have a maximum length of 100 characters and may be composed of any character from "a-z", "A-Z", "0-9" and "-_%\.". |
| buckets.default.rank | int | `0` | Rank determines the bucket’s place in the order in which the rebalance process handles the buckets on the cluster. The higher a bucket’s assigned integer (in relation to the integers assigned other buckets), the sooner in the rebalance process the bucket is handled. This assignment of rank allows a cluster’s most mission-critical data to be rebalanced with top priority. This option is only supported for Couchbase Server 7.6.0+. |
| buckets.default.replicas | int | `1` | Replicas defines how many copies of documents Couchbase server maintains.  This directly affects how fault tolerant a Couchbase cluster is.  With a single replica, the cluster can tolerate one data pod going down and still service requests without data loss.  The number of replicas also affect memory use.  With a single replica, the effective memory quota for documents is halved, with two replicas it is one third.  The number of replicas must be between 0 and 3, defaulting to 1. |
| buckets.default.scopes | object | `{"managed":false,"resources":[],"selector":{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null}}` | Scopes defines whether the Operator manages scopes for the bucket or not, and the set of scopes defined for the bucket. |
| buckets.default.scopes.managed | bool | `false` | Managed defines whether scopes are managed for this bucket. This field is `false` by default, and the Operator will take no actions that will affect scopes and collections in this bucket.  The default scope and collection will be present.  When set to `true`, the Operator will manage user defined scopes, and optionally, their collections as defined by the `CouchbaseScope`, `CouchbaseScopeGroup`, `CouchbaseCollection` and `CouchbaseCollectionGroup` resource documentation.  If this field is set to `false` while the  already managed, then the Operator will leave whatever configuration is already present. |
| buckets.default.scopes.resources | list | `[]` | Resources is an explicit list of named resources that will be considered for inclusion in this bucket.  If a resource reference doesn't match a resource, then no error conditions are raised due to undefined resource creation ordering and eventual consistency. |
| buckets.default.scopes.selector | object | `{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null}` | Selector allows resources to be implicitly considered for inclusion in this bucket.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes- api/v1.28/#labelselector-v1-meta |
| buckets.default.scopes.selector.matchExpressions | object | `{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null}` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. |
| buckets.default.scopes.selector.matchLabels | string | `nil` | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed. |
| buckets.default.storageBackend | string | `"couchstore"` | StorageBackend to be assigned to and used by the bucket. Only valid for Couchbase Server 7.0.0 onward. Two different backend storage mechanisms can be used - "couchstore" or "magma", defaulting to "couchstore". Note: "magma" is only valid for Couchbase Server 7.1.0 onward. |
| cluster.antiAffinity | bool | `false` | AntiAffinity forces the Operator to schedule different Couchbase server pods on different Kubernetes nodes.  Anti-affinity reduces the likelihood of unrecoverable failure in the event of a node issue.  Use of anti-affinity is highly recommended for production clusters. |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation | object | `{"cpuLimits":"4","cpuRequests":"2","enabled":false,"overheadPercent":25}` | AutoResourceAllocation populates pod resource requests based on the services running on that pod.  When enabled, this feature will calculate the memory request as the total of service allocations defined in `spec.cluster`, plus an overhead defined by `spec.autoResourceAllocation.overheadPercent`.Changing individual allocations for a service will cause a cluster upgrade as allocations are modified in the underlying pods.  This field also allows default pod CPU requests and limits to be applied. All resource allocations can be overridden by explicitly configuring them in the `spec.servers.resources` field. |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.cpuLimits | string | `"4"` | CPULimits automatically populates the CPU limits across all Couchbase server pods.  This field defaults to "4" CPUs.  Explicitly specifying the CPU limit for a particular server class will override this value.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.cpuRequests | string | `"2"` | CPURequests automatically populates the CPU requests across all Couchbase server pods.  The default value of "2", is the minimum recommended number of CPUs required to run Couchbase Server.  Explicitly specifying the CPU request for a particular server class will override this value. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.enabled | bool | `false` | Enabled defines whether auto-resource allocation is enabled. |
| cluster.autoResourceAllocation.overheadPercent | int | `25` | OverheadPercent defines the amount of memory above that required for individual services on a pod.  For Couchbase Server this should be approximately 25%. |
| cluster.autoscaleStabilizationPeriod | string | `nil` | AutoscaleStabilizationPeriod defines how long after a rebalance the corresponding HorizontalPodAutoscaler should remain in maintenance mode. During maintenance mode all autoscaling is disabled since every HorizontalPodAutoscaler associated with the cluster becomes inactive. Since certain metrics can be unpredictable when Couchbase is rebalancing or upgrading, setting a stabilization period helps to prevent scaling recommendations from the HorizontalPodAutoscaler for a provided period of time.   Values must be a valid Kubernetes duration of 0s or higher: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration A value of 0, puts the cluster in maintenance mode during rebalance but immediately exits this mode once the rebalance has completed. When undefined, the HPA is never put into maintenance mode during rebalance. |
| cluster.backup.annotations | string | `nil` | Annotations defines additional annotations to appear on the backup/restore pods. |
| cluster.backup.image | string | `"couchbase/operator-backup:1.3.5"` | The Backup Image to run on backup pods. |

| cluster.backup.objectEndpoint.secret | string | `nil` | The name of the secret, in this namespace, that contains the CA certificate for verification of a TLS endpoint The secret must have the key with the name "tls.crt" |
| cluster.backup.objectEndpoint.url | string | `nil` | The host/address of the custom object endpoint. |
| cluster.backup.objectEndpoint.useVirtualPath | bool | `false` | UseVirtualPath will force the AWS SDK to use the new virtual style paths which are often required by S3 compatible object stores. |
| cluster.backup.resources | object | `{"claims":{"name":null},"limits":null,"requests":null}` | Resources is the resource requirements for the backup and restore containers.  Will be populated by defaults if not specified. |
| cluster.backup.resources.claims | object | `{"name":null}` | Claims lists the names of resources, defined in spec.resourceClaims, that are used by this container.   This is an alpha field and requires enabling the DynamicResourceAllocation feature gate.   This field is immutable. It can only be set for containers. |
| cluster.backup.resources.limits | string | `nil` | Limits describes the maximum amount of compute resources allowed. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage- resources-containers/ |
| cluster.backup.resources.requests | string | `nil` | Requests describes the minimum amount of compute resources required. If Requests is omitted for a container, it defaults to Limits if that is explicitly specified, otherwise to an implementation-defined value. Requests cannot exceed Limits. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/ |
| cluster.backup.s3Secret | string | `nil` | Deprecated: by CouchbaseBackup.spec.objectStore.secret S3Secret contains the key region and optionally access-key-id and secret-access-key for operating backups in S3. This field must be popluated when the `spec.s3bucket` field is specified for a backup or restore resource. |
| cluster.backup.selector | object | `{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null}` | Selector allows CouchbaseBackup and CouchbaseBackupRestore resources to be filtered based on labels. |
| cluster.backup.selector.matchExpressions | object | `{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null}` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. |
| cluster.backup.selector.matchLabels | string | `nil` | matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed. |
| cluster.backup.serviceAccountName | string | `"couchbase-backup"` | The Service Account to run backup (and restore) pods under. Without this backup pods will not be able to update status. |
| cluster.backup.tolerations | object | `{"effect":null,"key":null,"operator":null,"tolerationSeconds":null,"value":null}` | Tolerations specifies all backup and restore pod tolerations. |
| cluster.backup.tolerations.effect | string | `nil` | Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects. When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute. |
| cluster.backup.tolerations.key | string | `nil` | Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys. If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys. |
| cluster.backup.tolerations.operator | string | `nil` | Operator represents a key's relationship to the value. Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal. Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can tolerate all taints of a particular category. |
| cluster.backup.tolerations.tolerationSeconds | string | `nil` | TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default, it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system. |
| cluster.backup.tolerations.value | string | `nil` | Value is the taint value the toleration matches to. If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string. |
| cluster.backup.useIAMRole | bool | `false` | Deprecated: by CouchbaseBackup.spec.objectStore.useIAM UseIAMRole enables backup to fetch EC2 instance metadata. This allows the AWS SDK to use the EC2's IAM Role for S3 access. UseIAMRole will ignore credentials in s3Secret. |
| cluster.buckets | object | `{"managed":true,"selector":{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null},"synchronize":false}` | Buckets defines whether the Operator should manage buckets, and how to lookup bucket resources. |
| cluster.buckets.managed | bool | `true` | Managed defines whether buckets are managed by the Operator (true), or user managed (false). When Operator managed, all buckets must be defined with either CouchbaseBucket or CouchbaseEphemeralBucket resources.  Manual addition of buckets will be reverted by the Operator.  When user managed, the Operator will not interrogate buckets at all.  This field defaults to false. |
| cluster.buckets.selector | object | `{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null}` | Selector is a label selector used to list buckets in the namespace that are managed by the Operator. |
| cluster.buckets.selector.matchExpressions | object | `{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null}` | matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed. |

A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed. |
| cluster.buckets.synchronize | bool | `false` | Synchronize allows unmanaged buckets, scopes, and collections to be synchronized as Kubernetes resources by the Operator.  This feature is intended for development only and should not be used for production workloads.  The synchronization workflow starts with `spec.buckets.managed` being set to false, the user can manually create buckets, scopes, and collections using the Couchbase UI, or other tooling. When you wish to commit to Kubernetes resources, you must specify a unique label selector in the `spec.buckets.selector` field, and this field is set to true.  The Operator will create Kubernetes resources for you, and upon completion set the cluster's `Synchronized` status condition. Synchronizing will not create a Kubernetes resource for the Couchbase Server maintained _system scope. You may then safely set `spec.buckets.managed` to true and the Operator will manage these resources as per usual.  To update an already managed data topology, you must first set it to unmanaged, make any changes, and delete any old resources, then follow the standard synchronization workflow.  The Operator can not, and will not, ever delete, or make modifications to resource specifications that are intended to be user managed, or managed by a life cycle management tool. These actions must be instigated by an end user.  For a more complete experience, refer to the documentation for the `cao save` and `cao restore` CLI commands. |

More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources- containers/#resource-units-in-kubernetes |
| cluster.cluster.autoCompaction | object | `{"databaseFragmentationThreshold":{"percent":30,"size":null},"parallelCompaction":false,"timeWindow":{"abortCompactionOutsideWindow":false,"end":null,"start":null},"tombstonePurgeInterval":"72h","viewFragmentationThreshold":{"percent":30,"size":null}}` | AutoCompaction allows the configuration of auto-compaction, including on what conditions disk space is reclaimed and when it is allowed to run. Cluster level settings will be used as the default when creating new buckets and any changes to the settings will be applied to all existing buckets that have not had their auto-compaction settings individually modified. |
| cluster.cluster.autoCompaction.databaseFragmentationThreshold | object | `{"percent":30,"size":null}` | DatabaseFragmentationThreshold defines triggers for when database compaction should start. |
| cluster.cluster.autoCompaction.parallelCompaction | bool | `false` | ParallelCompaction controls whether database and view compactions can happen in parallel. |
| cluster.cluster.autoCompaction.timeWindow | object | `{"abortCompactionOutsideWindow":false,"end":null,"start":null}` | TimeWindow allows restriction of when compaction can occur. |
| cluster.cluster.autoCompaction.tombstonePurgeInterval | string | `"72h"` | TombstonePurgeInterval controls how long to wait before purging tombstones. This field must be in the range 1h-1440h, defaulting to 72h. More info:  https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration |
| cluster.cluster.autoCompaction.viewFragmentationThreshold | object | `{"percent":30,"size":null}` | ViewFragmentationThreshold defines triggers for when view compaction should start. |

| cluster.cluster.autoFailoverOnDataDiskIssuesTimePeriod | string | `"120s"` | AutoFailoverOnDataDiskIssuesTimePeriod defines how long to wait for transient errors before failing over a faulty disk.  This field must be in the range 5-3600s, defaulting to 120s.  More info: https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration |
| cluster.cluster.autoFailoverServerGroup | bool | `false` | AutoFailoverServerGroup whether to enable failing over a server group. This field is ignored in server versions 7.1+ as it has been removed from the Couchbase API |
| cluster.cluster.autoFailoverTimeout | string | `"120s"` | AutoFailoverTimeout defines how long Couchbase server will wait between a pod being witnessed as down, until when it will failover the pod. Couchbase server will only failover pods if it deems it safe to do so, and not result in data loss.  This field must be in the range 5-3600s, defaulting to 120s. More info:  https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration |
| cluster.cluster.clusterName | string | `nil` | ClusterName defines the name of the cluster, as displayed in the Couchbase UI. By default, the cluster name is that specified in the CouchbaseCluster resource's metadata. |

This is not part of the audit REST API, it is intended to handle GC automatically for the audit logs. By default the Couchbase Server rotates the audit logs but does not clean up the rotated logs. This is left as an operation for the cluster administrator to manage, the operator allows for us to automate this: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-security/manage- auditing.html |
| cluster.logging.audit.rotation | object | `{"interval":"15m","pruneAge":"0","size":"20Mi"}` | The interval to optionally rotate the audit log. This is passed to the REST API, see here for details: https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-security/manage- auditing.html |

| cluster.logging.logRetentionTime | string | `nil` | LogRetentionTime gives the time to keep persistent log PVCs alive for. |
| cluster.logging.server.configurationName | string | `"fluent-bit-config"` | ConfigurationName is the name of the Secret to use holding the logging configuration in the namespace. A Secret is used to ensure we can safely store credentials but this can be populated from plaintext if acceptable too. If it does not exist then one will be created with defaults in the namespace so it can be easily updated whilst running. Note that if running multiple clusters in the same kubernetes namespace then you should use a separate Secret for each, otherwise the first cluster will take ownership (if created) and the Secret will be cleaned up when that cluster is removed. If running clusters in separate namespaces then they will be separate Secrets anyway. |
| cluster.logging.server.enabled | bool | `false` | Enabled is a boolean that enables the logging sidecar container. |
| cluster.logging.server.manageConfiguration | bool | `true` | A boolean which indicates whether the operator should manage the configuration or not. If omitted then this defaults to true which means the operator will attempt to reconcile it to default values. To use a custom configuration make sure to set this to false. Note that the ownership of any Secret is not changed so if a Secret is created externally it can be updated by the operator but it's ownership stays the same so it will be cleaned up when it's owner is. |
| cluster.logging.server.sidecar | object | `{"configurationMountPath":"/fluent-bit/config/","image":"couchbase/fluent-bit:1.2.9","resources":{"claims":{"name":null},"limits":null,"requests":null}}` | Any specific logging sidecar container configuration. |

When this field is not set, Couchbase server will default to using IPv4 for internal communication and also support IPv6 on dual stack systems. Setting this field to either IPv4 or IPv6 will force Couchbase to use the selected protocol for internal communication, and also disable all other protocols to provide added security and simplicty when defining firewall rules.  Disabling of address families is only supported in Couchbase Server 7.0.2+. |

| cluster.networking.cloudNativeGateway.tls | object | `{"serverSecretName":null}` | TLS defines the TLS configuration for the Cloud Native Gateway server including server and client certificate configuration, and TLS security policies. If no TLS config are explicitly provided, the operator generates/manages self-signed certs/keys and creates a k8s secret named `couchbase-cloud-native-gateway-self-signed-secret-<cluster-name>` unique to a Couchbase cluster, which is volume mounted to the cb k8s pod. This action could be overidden at the outset or later, by using the below TLS config or generating the secret of same name as `couchbase- cloud-native-gateway-self-signed-secret-<cluster-name>` with certificates conforming to the keys of well-known type "kubernetes.io/tls" with "tls.crt" and "tls.key". N.B. The secret is on per cluster basis so it's advised to use the unique cluster name else would be ignored. |

These annotations can be used directly by a Kubernetes External-DNS controller to replicate load balancer service IP addresses into a public DNS server. |
| cluster.networking.exposeAdminConsole | bool | `true` | ExposeAdminConsole creates a service referencing the admin console. The service is configured by the adminConsoleServiceTemplate field. |
| cluster.networking.exposedFeatureServiceTemplate | object | `{"metadata":{"annotations":null,"labels":null},"spec":{"clusterIP":null,"clusterIPs":null,"externalIPs":null,"externalName":null,"externalTrafficPolicy":null,"healthCheckNodePort":null,"internalTrafficPolicy":null,"ipFamilies":null,"ipFamilyPolicy":null,"loadBalancerClass":null,"loadBalancerIP":null,"loadBalancerSourceRanges":null,"sessionAffinity":null,"sessionAffinityConfig":{"clientIP":{"timeoutSeconds":null}},"type":"NodePort"}}` | ExposedFeatureServiceTemplate provides a template used by the Operator to create and manage per-pod services.  This allows services to be annotated, the service type defined and any other options that Kubernetes provides.  When using a LoadBalancer service type, TLS and dynamic DNS must also be enabled. The Operator reserves the right to modify or replace any field.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes- api/v1.28/#service-v1-core |

| cluster.networking.exposedFeatureTrafficPolicy | string | `nil` | DEPRECATED  - by exposedFeatureServiceTemplate. ExposedFeatureTrafficPolicy defines how packets should be routed from a load balancer service to a Couchbase pod.  When local, traffic is routed directly to the pod.  When cluster, traffic is routed to any node, then forwarded on.  While cluster routing may be slower, there are some situations where it is required for connectivity.  This field must be either "Cluster" or "Local", defaulting to "Local", |
| cluster.networking.exposedFeatures | list | `["client","xdcr"]` | ExposedFeatures is a list of Couchbase features to expose when using a networking model that exposes the Couchbase cluster externally to Kubernetes.  This field also triggers the creation of per-pod services used by clients to connect to the Couchbase cluster.  When admin, only the administrator port is exposed, allowing remote administration.  When xdcr, only the services required for remote replication are exposed. The xdcr feature is only required when the cluster is the destination of an XDCR replication.  When client, all services are exposed as required for client SDK operation. This field may contain any of "admin", "xdcr" and "client". Each feature may only be included once. |
| cluster.networking.loadBalancerSourceRanges | string | `nil` | DEPRECATED - by adminConsoleServiceTemplate and exposedFeatureServiceTemplate. LoadBalancerSourceRanges applies only when an exposed service is of type LoadBalancer and limits the source IP ranges that are allowed to use the service.

| cluster.networking.waitForAddressReachable | string | `"10m"` | WaitForAddressReachable is used to set the timeout between when polling of external addresses is started, and when it is deemed a failure. Polling of DNS name availability inherently dangerous due to negative caching, so prefer the use of an initial `waitForAddressReachableDelay` to allow propagation. |
| cluster.networking.waitForAddressReachableDelay | string | `"2m"` | WaitForAddressReachableDelay is used to defer operator checks that ensure external addresses are reachable before new nodes are balanced in to the cluster.  This prevents negative DNS caching while waiting for external-DDNS controllers to propagate addresses. |
| cluster.onlineVolumeExpansionTimeoutInMins | string | `nil` | OnlineVolumeExpansionTimeoutInMins must be provided as a retry mechanism with a timeout in minutes for expanding volumes. This must only be provided, if EnableOnlineVolumeExpansion is set to true. Value must be between 0 and 30. If no value is provided, then it defaults to 10 minutes. |
| cluster.paused | bool | `false` | Paused is to pause the control of the operator for the Couchbase cluster. This does not pause the cluster itself, instead stopping the operator from taking any action. |
| cluster.perServiceClassPDB | bool | `false` | PerServiceClassPDB allows pod disruption budgets to be created on a per- serviceClass basis. |
| cluster.platform | string | `nil` | Platform gives a hint as to what platform we are running on and how to configure services.  This field must be one of "aws", "gke" or "azure". |
| cluster.recoveryPolicy | string | `nil` | RecoveryPolicy controls how aggressive the Operator is when recovering cluster topology.  When PrioritizeDataIntegrity, the Operator will delegate failover exclusively to Couchbase server, relying on it to only allow recovery when safe to do so.  When PrioritizeUptime, the Operator will wait for a period after the expected auto-failover of the cluster, before forcefully failing-over the pods. This may cause data loss, and is only expected to be used on clusters with ephemeral data, where the loss of the pod means that the data is known to be unrecoverable. This field must be either "PrioritizeDataIntegrity" or "PrioritizeUptime", defaulting to "PrioritizeDataIntegrity". |
| cluster.rollingUpgrade | object | `{"maxUpgradable":null,"maxUpgradablePercent":null}` | When `spec.upgradeStrategy` is set to `RollingUpgrade` it will, by default, upgrade one pod at a time.  If this field is specified then that number can be increased. |
| cluster.rollingUpgrade.maxUpgradable | string | `nil` | MaxUpgradable allows the number of pods affected by an upgrade at any one time to be increased.  By default a rolling upgrade will upgrade one pod at a time.  This field allows that limit to be removed. This field must be greater than zero. The smallest of `maxUpgradable` and `maxUpgradablePercent` takes precedence if both are defined. |
| cluster.rollingUpgrade.maxUpgradablePercent | string | `nil` | MaxUpgradablePercent allows the number of pods affected by an upgrade at any one time to be increased.  By default a rolling upgrade will upgrade one pod at a time.  This field allows that limit to be removed. This field must be an integer percentage, e.g. "10%", in the range 1% to 100%. Percentages are relative to the total cluster size, and rounded down to the nearest whole number, with a minimum of 1.  For example, a 10 pod cluster, and 25% allowed to upgrade, would yield 2.5 pods per iteration, rounded down to 2. The smallest of `maxUpgradable` and `maxUpgradablePercent` takes precedence if both are defined. |
| cluster.security.adminSecret | string | `""` | AdminSecret is the name of a Kubernetes secret to use for administrator authentication. The admin secret must contain the keys "username" and "password".  The password data must be at least 6 characters in length, and not contain the any of the characters `()<>,;:\"/[]?={}`. |

When using persistent volumes you may need to set the fsGroup field in order to write to the volume.  For non-root clusters you must also set runAsUser to 1000, corresponding to the Couchbase user in official container images.  More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.fsGroup | int | `1000` | A special supplemental group that applies to all containers in a pod. Some volume types allow the Kubelet to change the ownership of that volume to be owned by the pod:   1. The owning GID will be the FSGroup 2. The setgid bit is set (new files created in the volume will be owned by FSGroup) 3. The permission bits are OR'd with rw-rw----   If unset, the Kubelet will not modify the ownership and permissions of any volume. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.fsGroupChangePolicy | string | `nil` | fsGroupChangePolicy defines behavior of changing ownership and permission of the volume before being exposed inside Pod. This field will only apply to volume types which support fsGroup based ownership(and permissions). It will have no effect on ephemeral volume types such as: secret, configmaps and emptydir. Valid values are "OnRootMismatch" and "Always". If not specified, "Always" is used. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.runAsGroup | string | `nil` | The GID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Uses runtime default if unset. May also be set in SecurityContext.

| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.runAsNonRoot | bool | `true` | Indicates that the container must run as a non-root user. If true, the Kubelet will validate the image at runtime to ensure that it does not run as UID 0 (root) and fail to start the container if it does. If unset or false, no such validation will be performed. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.runAsUser | int | `1000` | The UID to run the entrypoint of the container process. Defaults to user specified in image metadata if unspecified. May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container.

| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.seLinuxOptions | object | `{"level":null,"role":null,"type":null,"user":null}` | The SELinux context to be applied to all containers. If unspecified, the container runtime will allocate a random SELinux context for each container.  May also be set in SecurityContext.  If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence for that container. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.seccompProfile | object | `{"localhostProfile":null,"type":null}` | The seccomp options to use by the containers in this pod. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.supplementalGroups | string | `nil` | A list of groups applied to the first process run in each container, in addition to the container's primary GID, the fsGroup (if specified), and group memberships defined in the container image for the uid of the container process. If unspecified, no additional groups are added to any container. Note that group memberships defined in the container image for the uid of the container process are still effective, even if they are not included in this list. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.sysctls | object | `{"name":null,"value":null}` | Sysctls hold a list of namespaced sysctls used for the pod. Pods with unsupported sysctls (by the container runtime) might fail to launch. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. |
| cluster.security.podSecurityContext.windowsOptions | object | `{"gmsaCredentialSpec":null,"gmsaCredentialSpecName":null,"hostProcess":false,"runAsUserName":null}` | The Windows specific settings applied to all containers. If unspecified, the options within a container's SecurityContext will be used. If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence. Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is linux. |
| cluster.security.rbac | object | `{"managed":true,"selector":{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null}}` | RBAC is the options provided for enabling and selecting RBAC User resources to manage. |
| cluster.security.rbac.managed | bool | `true` | Managed defines whether RBAC is managed by us or the clients. |
| cluster.security.rbac.selector | object | `{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null}` | Selector is a label selector used to list RBAC resources in the namespace that are managed by the Operator. |
| cluster.security.securityContext | object | `{"allowPrivilegeEscalation":false}` | SecurityContext defines the security options the container should be run with. If set, the fields of SecurityContext override the equivalent fields of PodSecurityContext. Use securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation field to grant more privileges than its parent process. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/ |
| cluster.security.securityContext.allowPrivilegeEscalation | bool | `false` | AllowPrivilegeEscalation controls whether a process can gain more privileges than its parent process. This bool directly controls if the no_new_privs flag will be set on the container process. AllowPrivilegeEscalation is true always when the container is: 1) run as Privileged 2) has CAP_SYS_ADMIN Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is windows. |
| cluster.security.uiSessionTimeout | int | `0` | UISessionTimeout sets how long, in minutes, before a user is declared inactive and signed out from the Couchbase Server UI. 0 represents no time out. |
| cluster.security.username | string | `"Administrator"` | Cluster administrator username |
| cluster.serverGroups | string | `nil` | ServerGroups define the set of availability zones you want to distribute pods over, and construct Couchbase server groups for.  By default, most cloud providers will label nodes with the key "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", the values associated with that key are used here to provide explicit scheduling by the Operator.  You may manually label nodes using the "topology.kubernetes.io/zone" key, to provide failure-domain aware scheduling when none is provided for you.  Global server groups are applied to all server classes, and may be overridden on a per-server class basis to give more control over scheduling and server groups. |
| cluster.servers.default.autoscaleEnabled | bool | `false` | AutoscaledEnabled defines whether the autoscaling feature is enabled for this class. When true, the Operator will create a CouchbaseAutoscaler resource for this server class.

At least one class must contain the data service.  The field may contain any of "data", "index", "query", "search", "eventing" or "analytics". Each service may only be specified once. An empty list can also be specified for a serviceless class ("[]"). |
| cluster.servers.default.size | int | `3` | Size is the expected requested of the server class.  This field must be greater than or equal to 1. |
| cluster.softwareUpdateNotifications | bool | `false` | SoftwareUpdateNotifications enables software update notifications in the UI. When enabled, the UI will alert when a Couchbase server upgrade is available. |
| cluster.upgradeProcess | string | `nil` | UpgradeProcess defines the process that will be used when performing a couchbase cluster upgrade. When SwapRebalance is requested (default), pods will be upgraded using either a RollingUpgrade or ImmediateUpgrade (determined by UpgradeStrategy). When InPlaceUpgrade is requested, the operator will perform an in-place upgrade on a best effort basis. InPlaceUpgrade cannot be used if the UpgradeStrategy is set to ImmediateUpgrade. |
| cluster.upgradeStrategy | string | `nil` | UpgradeStrategy controls how aggressive the Operator is when performing a cluster upgrade.  When a rolling upgrade is requested, pods are upgraded one at a time.  This strategy is slower, however less disruptive.  When an immediate upgrade strategy is requested, all pods are upgraded at the same time.  This strategy is faster, but more disruptive.  This field must be either "RollingUpgrade" or "ImmediateUpgrade", defaulting to "RollingUpgrade". |
| cluster.volumeClaimTemplates | object | `{"metadata":{"annotations":null,"labels":null,"name":null},"spec":{"accessModes":null,"dataSourceRef":{"apiGroup":null,"kind":null,"name":null,"namespace":null},"resources":{"claims":{"name":null},"limits":null,"requests":null},"selector":{"matchExpressions":{"key":null,"operator":null,"values":null},"matchLabels":null},"storageClassName":null,"volumeMode":null,"volumeName":null}}` | VolumeClaimTemplates define the desired characteristics of a volume that can be requested/claimed by a pod, for example the storage class to use and the volume size.

| cluster.volumeClaimTemplates.spec.dataSourceRef | object | `{"apiGroup":null,"kind":null,"name":null,"namespace":null}` | dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty. There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef   allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified. * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects   in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. |
